## Smart Contract

#### Re-open a Contract Account

Before starting this tutorial, there are some important premises that need to be made.

We previously created a contract account following the instruction showed [here](https://github.com/blockchain-unica/asc1-experiments/blob/master/smart_contract/create_contract_account.md#create_contract_account). Then, we closed the account as explained [here](https://github.com/blockchain-unica/asc1-experiments/blob/master/smart_contract/close_contract_account%20copy.md#close_contract_account).
